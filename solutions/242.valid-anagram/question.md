Given two strings s and t&nbsp;, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

Example 1:


Input: s = &quot;anagram&quot;, t = &quot;nagaram&quot;
Output: true


Example 2:


Input: s = &quot;rat&quot;, t = &quot;car&quot;
Output: false


Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
