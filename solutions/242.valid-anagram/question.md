Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

For example,
s = &quot;anagram&quot;, t = &quot;nagaram&quot;, return true.
s = &quot;rat&quot;, t = &quot;car&quot;, return false.

Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
